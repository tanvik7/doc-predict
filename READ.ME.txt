Project Overview

This web application predicts the best doctors (NPIs)
 to target for a survey based on their login activity, time spent, and attempts.
 Instead of sending survey invitations to all doctors, 
 this app uses Machine Learning (Random Forest & Logistic Regression with ensembling)
 to predict the doctors most likely to respond at a given time.

The user inputs a specific time, 
and the app generates a downloadable CSV file containing 
the NPIs of the doctors most likely to participate in the survey.
